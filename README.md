# Fire Simulator and drone monitoring system for the ARIES project


This repository contains the first version of the fire propagation simulator developed in the scope of the ESA funded project ARIES.
To run the simulation it is necessary to:

 - Download the NDVI data and export it with GIS


A full documentation of the functionalities of this simulator is currenlty being developed.
The mathematical model and the logic of the algorithms implemented are currently under review on for publication on an international journal.
