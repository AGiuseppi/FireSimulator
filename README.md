# Fire Simulator and drone monitoring system for the ARIES project


This repository contains the first version of the fire propagation simulator developed in the scope of the ESA funded project ARIES.
To run the simulation it is necessary to:

 - Download the NDVI data and export it with GIS
 - 
examples of simulation outputs:
